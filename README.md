## Problem Statement

In a neighborhood, it can be challenging to discover local events like bake sales, lemonade stands, or individuals giving away excess produce from their gardens. Scanning through platforms like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace for such specific needs can be inefficient and time-consuming.

**ExtraCookies** solves this problem by providing a dedicated platform where users can:

- View details about each listing, including pictures and descriptions.

- Rely on seller ratings to make informed decisions.

- **Detailed Listings**: Sellers can post pictures and detailed descriptions of their items.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: The application layout adjusts for mobile devices to ensure a smooth user experience on all screens.
